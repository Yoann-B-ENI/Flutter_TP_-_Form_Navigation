# Flutter TP Forms & Navigation

- 0.1.0 : Form to add element to a list, Tab Bar between list display and form
- 0.2.0 : Form validation
- 0.3.1 : Route Navigation to other page (list of posts -> post details)
- 0.4.0 : Simple API call, using just async await, no Future, no SetState
- 0.4.1 : API call with Futures like the doc does (still not set state)
- split into files out of instinct, probably not the common Flutter project architecture
